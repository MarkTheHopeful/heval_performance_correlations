Things to do:

* Get the right system promt for human eval/human eval+
* Add iteration over downloaded dataset (that sends the task to the model)
* Add evaluation function for the results produced by an LLM (probably copy the one from the original repo)
* Add pass@k function (optionally)
* Add a basic metric on task just as an example
* Add a basic metric on generated solution just as an example
* After everything else is done: some visualization

P.S.
Don't forget to use your Grazie token. Probably it would be meaningful to change access from Production to Staging/Dev if you have one.
